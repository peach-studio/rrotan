Don’t tell me you are working hard because  
When you are saying this  
You're talking instead of working  
So don’t tell me you’re working hard  
Unless you want to lie to me  
  
Don’t tell me you are working hard because  
Something you spent your life fighting for  
I had it as soon as I was born  
So don’t tell me you’re working hard  
Otherwise you will feel inferior  
  
Since you want to lie to me  
Make you feel inferior, why should I not?
