+++
When you ask me: Where am I?  
You are asking  
Where am I, while you're asking me?  
Or  
Where am I, while I'm answering you?  
Or  
Where am I, while you're seeing my answer?  
  
Where am I, while you're asking me  
I have forgotten.  
Where am I, while I'm answering you  
It's none of your business.  
As far as you see these answers, where are I?  
  
——  
  
Dear!  
Maybe I'm dead  
But I'm here!  
If not  
The guy who is answering you  
Is who?
