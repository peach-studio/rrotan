If you say  
You do not have any pursuit  
Then you may forget  
No pursuit is also a pursuit  
  
This is like  
If one does not see anything  
Then he actually saw "Nothing"  
  
This shows  
Nothingness can not be expressed  
Also unobservable  
Because once it's expressed and observed  
It becomes the "nothingness"  
and no longer empty  
  
This is the essence of the Dharma:  
"A man who explains dharma has no dharma to explain, and this is exactly the explanation of dharma."
