title = "Photon, electronics are both fools"

+++
If to say  
There is a kind of fool  
Called 'buy before crashing'  
There is also a kind of fool  
Called 'sell before soared'  
So these two fools have one thing in common  
——  
Before you talk about him  
He does not exist  
After you talk about him  
He does not exist  
If and only when you observed him  
He exists  
  
The so-called electron, photon  
Is not such a fool?
