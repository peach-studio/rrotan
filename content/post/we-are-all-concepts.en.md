If there is an 'A'  
'Not-A' appears  
Then there must be a 'B' who is observing 'A'  
'Not-B' appears  
And then appears a ‘C’ who is observing 'B'  
  
If 'C' is 'A'  
Then 'A' and 'B' are observing each other  
'B' must belong to 'Not-A'  
'A' must belong to 'Not-B'  
  
In summary  
If there is no 'A'    
Then no 'Not-A'  
Then no 'B'  
Then no 'Not-B'  
  
So launched:  
If there is an 'A', there is an 'B'  
If there is no 'A', there is no 'B'  
  
It proves that the so-called "world" is just a concept
