title = "Pure pollution"
+++
When people's relationships became a piece of paper:  
It is only effective if it is sealed  
Only do those things written on it  
We hate such a world  
  
But when we donâ€™t do this kind of agreement  
We abuse each other  
In order to take up a little more  
  
But dear, you must know:  
If there is no pollution,  
What is pure?
